This site was made specifically for practicing React skills. It is very simple, but was made right after the transition from Vue. Not everything went smoothly, unfortunately, there were some difficulties with a personal blog, which will appear a little later. This site is hosted on Github Pages. There is also an interesting story with this - I had to quickly create a 404 page due to the lack of SPA support. In general, the stack is, if possible, TypeScript, pure React, Sass. It was made in the shortest possible time - in 4 days, along with the design and some functionality. I hope you will enjoy.
